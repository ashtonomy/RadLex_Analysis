Pathology.—By common usage, the term lymphadenopathy is usually restricted to enlargement, due to any cause, of the lymph nodes. Synonyms include lymph node enlargement (preferred) and adenopathy.
CT scans.—There is a wide range in the size of normal lymph nodes. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes range in size from sub-CT resolution to 12 mm. Somewhat arbitrary thresholds for the upper limit of normal of 1 cm in short-axis diameter for mediastinal nodes (79) and 3 mm for most hilar nodes (80) have been reported, but size criteria do not allow reliable differentiation between healthy and diseased lymph nodes (Fig 36).

pneumothorax,"An accumulation of air or gas in the pleural space, which may occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma or a pathological process, or be introduced deliberately ( = pneumothorax, artificial). (Dorland, 27th ed) [MeSH]
Pathophysiology.—Pneumothorax refers to the presence of gas in the pleural space. Qualifiers include spontaneous, traumatic, diagnostic, and tension. Tension pneumothorax is the accumulation of intrapleural gas under pressure. In this situation, the ipsilateral lung will, if normal, collapse completely; however, a less than normally compliant lung may remain partially inflated. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—On chest radiographs, a visceral pleural edge is visible (Fig 55) unless the pneumothorax is very small or the pleural edge is not tangential to the x-ray beam. Tension pneumothorax may be associated with considerable shift of the mediastinum and/or depression of the hemidiaphragm. Some shift can occur without tension because the pleural pressure in the presence of pneumothorax becomes atmospheric, while the pleural pressure in the contralateral hemithorax remains negative.

By this logic, stress radiographs of the ankle joint would involve a stress maneuver, since the stress applied is intended to test the stability of the joint.  Similarly, weight-bearing radiographs of the foot would involve a weight-bearing maneuver, since the act of standing is intended to assess bony alignment under load-carrying conditions.  Carrying this logic further, terms indicating the absence of a challenge would also be maneuver terms, such as “without maneuver”. [Radlex 9-28-2016]"

emphysema,"A subcategory of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The disease is characterized by anatomic alterations of the lungs, such as the enlargement of airspaces and destruction of alveolar walls. [MeSH]
Pathology.—Emphysema is characterized by permanently enlarged airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole with destruction of alveolar walls (42,43). Absence of “obvious fibrosis” was historically regarded as an additional criterion (42), but the validity of that criterion has been questioned because some interstitial fibrosis may be present in emphysema secondary to cigarette smoking (56,57). Emphysema is usually classified in terms of the part of the acinus predominantly affected: proximal (centriacinar, more commonly termed centrilobular, emphysema), distal (paraseptal emphysema), or whole acinus (panacinar or, less commonly, panlobular emphysema). 
CT scans.—The CT appearance of emphysema consists of focal areas or regions of low attenuation, usually without visible walls (58). In the case of panacinar emphysema, decreased attenuation is more diffuse. (See also bullous emphysema, centrilobular emphysema, panacinar emphysema, paraseptal emphysema.)

Ground-glass opacity, if present, is less extensive than reticular and honeycombing patterns. The typical radiologic findings (65,66) are also encountered in usual interstitial pneumonia secondary to specific causes, such as asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis (asbestosis), and the diagnosis is usually one of exclusion.

pulmonary blood flow redistribution,"Pathophysiology.—Pulmonary blood flow redistribution refers to any departure from the normal distribution of blood flow in the lungs that is caused by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance elsewhere in the pulmonary vascular bed. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Pulmonary blood flow redistribution is indicated by a decrease in the size and/or number of visible pulmonary vessels in one or more lung regions (Fig 59), with a corresponding increase in number and/or size of pulmonary vessels in other parts of the lung. Upper lobe blood diversion in patients with mitral valve disease is the archetypal example of redistribution (112,113).  [Fleischner Society]"

Comparison between inspiratory and expiratory CT scans can be helpful when air trapping is subtle or diffuse (11,12) (Fig 4). Differentiation from areas of decreased attenuation resulting from hypoperfusion as a consequence of an occlusive vascular disorder (eg, chronic thromboembolism) may be problematic (13), but other findings of airways versus vascular disease are usually present.

On CT scans, it appears as hazy increased opacity of lung, with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins (Fig 23). It is caused by partial filling of airspaces, interstitial thickening (due to fluid, cells, and/or fibrosis), partial collapse of alveoli, increased capillary blood volume, or a combination of these, the common factor being the partial displacement of air (59,60). Ground-glass opacity is less opaque than consolidation, in which bronchovascular margins are obscured. (See also consolidation.) [Fleischner Society]"

linear atelectasis,"Pathophysiology.—Atelectasis is reduced inflation of all or part of the lung (20). One of the commonest mechanisms is resorption of air distal to airway obstruction (eg, an endobronchial neoplasm) (21). The synonym collapse is often used interchangeably with atelectasis, particularly when it is severe or accompanied by obvious increase in lung opacity. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Reduced volume is seen, accompanied by increased opacity (chest radiograph) or attenuation (CT scan) in the affected part of the lung (Fig 8). Atelectasis is often associated with abnormal displacement of fissures, bronchi, vessels, diaphragm, heart, or mediastinum (22). The distribution can be lobar, segmental, or subsegmental. Atelectasis is often qualified by descriptors such as linear, discoid, or platelike. (See also linear atelectasis, rounded atelectasis.)  [Fleischner Society]"

Radiographs and CT scans.—A bulla appears as a rounded focal lucency or area of decreased attenuation, 1 cm or more in diameter, bounded by a thin wall (Fig 16). Multiple bullae are often present and are associated with other signs of pulmonary emphysema (centrilobular and paraseptal). [Fleischner Society]"

mediastinal compartment,"Anatomy.—Nominal anatomic compartments of the mediastinum include the anterior, middle, posterior, and (in some schemes) superior compartments. The anterior compartment is bounded anteriorly by the sternum and posteriorly by the anterior surface of the pericardium, the ascending aorta, and the brachiocephalic vessels. The middle compartment is bounded by the posterior margin of the anterior division and the anterior margin of the posterior division. The posterior compartment is bounded anteriorly by the posterior margins of the pericardium and great vessels and posteriorly by the thoracic vertebral bodies. In the four-compartment model, the superior compartment is defined as the compartment above the plane between the sternal angle to the T4-5 intervertebral disk or, more simply, above the aortic arch (84,85). Exact anatomic boundaries between the compartments do not exist, and there are no barriers (other than the pericardium) to prevent the spread of disease between compartments. Other classifications exist, but the three- and four-compartment models are the most commonly used. [Fleischner Society]"

Kerley A lines are predominantly situated in the upper lobes, are 2–6 cm long, and can be seen as fine lines radially oriented toward the hila. In recent years, the anatomically descriptive terms septal lines and septal thickening have gained favor over Kerley lines. On CT scans, disease affecting one of the components of the septa (see interlobular septum) may be responsible for thickening and so render septa visible. On thin-section CT scans, septal thickening may be smooth or nodular (70) (Fig 28), which may help refine the differential diagnosis. (See also interlobular septum, beaded septum.)

secondary pulmonary lobule,"Anatomy.—The lobule is the smallest unit of lung surrounded by connective-tissue septa, as defined by Miller (78) and Heitzman et al (40). The lobule is also referred to as the secondary pulmonary lobule; it contains a variable number of acini, is irregularly polyhedral in shape, and varies in size from 1.0 to 2.5 cm in diameter. The centrilobular structures, or core structures, include bronchioles and their accompanying pulmonary arterioles and lymphatic vessels. The connective-tissue septa surrounding the pulmonary lobule—the interlobular septa, which contain veins and lymphatic vessels—are best developed in the periphery in the anterior, lateral, and juxtamediastinal regions of the upper and middle lobes. 
CT scans.—On thin-section CT scans, the three basic components of the lobule—the interlobular septa and septal structures, the central lobular region (centrilobular structures), and the lobular parenchyma—can be identified, particularly in disease states. Peripheral lobules are more uniform in appearance and pyramidal in shape than are central lobules (4) (Fig 35).  [Fleischner Society]"

The synonym collapse is often used interchangeably with atelectasis, particularly when it is severe or accompanied by obvious increase in lung opacity. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Reduced volume is seen, accompanied by increased opacity (chest radiograph) or attenuation (CT scan) in the affected part of the lung (Fig 8). Atelectasis is often associated with abnormal displacement of fissures, bronchi, vessels, diaphragm, heart, or mediastinum (22). The distribution can be lobar, segmental, or subsegmental. Atelectasis is often qualified by descriptors such as linear, discoid, or platelike. (See also linear atelectasis, rounded atelectasis.)  [Fleischner Society]"

tension pneumothorax,"Pathophysiology.—Pneumothorax refers to the presence of gas in the pleural space. Qualifiers include spontaneous, traumatic, diagnostic, and tension. Tension pneumothorax is the accumulation of intrapleural gas under pressure. In this situation, the ipsilateral lung will, if normal, collapse completely; however, a less than normally compliant lung may remain partially inflated. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—On chest radiographs, a visceral pleural edge is visible (Fig 55) unless the pneumothorax is very small or the pleural edge is not tangential to the x-ray beam. Tension pneumothorax may be associated with considerable shift of the mediastinum and/or depression of the hemidiaphragm. Some shift can occur without tension because the pleural pressure in the presence of pneumothorax becomes atmospheric, while the pleural pressure in the contralateral hemithorax remains negative.

The camera is rotated 180 or 360 degrees around the patient to capture images at multiple positions along the arc. The computer is then used to reconstruct the transaxial, sagittal, and coronal images from the 3-dimensional distribution of radionuclides in the organ. The advantages of SPECT are that it can be used to observe biochemical and physiological processes as well as size and volume of the organ. The disadvantage is that, unlike positron-emission tomography where the positron-electron annihilation results in the emission of 2 photons at 180 degrees from each other, SPECT requires physical collimation to line up the photons, which results in the loss of many available photons and hence degrades the image.

Most of these fibers originate from cells of the trigeminal ganglion and project to the trigeminal nucleus of the brain stem. The smaller motor part arises from the brain stem trigeminal motor nucleus and innervates the muscles of mastication. [MeSH]"

organizing pneumonia,"Pathology.—Organizing pneumonia manifests as a histologic pattern characterized by loose plugs of connective tissue in the airspaces and distal airways. Interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are minimal or absent. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, or COP, is a distinctive clinical disorder among the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (5), but the histologic pattern of organizing pneumonia is encountered in many different situations, including pulmonary infection, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and collagen vascular diseases. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Airspace consolidation is the cardinal feature of organizing pneumonia on chest radiographs and CT scans. In COP, the distribution is typically subpleural and basal (Fig 45) and sometimes bronchocentric (96). Other manifestations of organizing pneumonia include ground-glass opacity, tree-in-bud pattern, and nodular opacities (37).  [Fleischner Society]"

These lines represent interlobular septa, which are usually less than 1 cm in length and parallel to one another at right angles to the pleura. They are located peripherally in contact with the pleura, but are generally absent along fissural surfaces. They may be seen in any zone but are most frequently observed at the lung bases at the costophrenic angles on the PA radiograph, and in the substernal region on lateral radiographs. Kerley B lines are seen in Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD)."

late arterial phase,"[LI-RADS}: In LI-RADS, the arterial phase refers to the hepatic arterial phase unless otherwise specified. The arterial phase is a post-contrast injection time range in which images have the following characteristics:

Hepatic artery and branches are fully enhanced.
Hepatic veins not yet enhanced by antegrade flow.
Comments:

Arterial phase imaging is required for both CT and MRI.
Hepatic arterial phase may be subclassified as early and late hepatic arterial phase.
Early hepatic arterial phase: portal vein is not yet enhanced.
Late hepatic arterial phase: portal vein is enhanced.
Late hepatic arterial phase is strongly preferred for HCC diagnosis and staging, because the degree of enhancement in HCC usually is higher in the late than in the early hepatic arterial phase. Some HCCs may show hyper-enhancement only in the late hepatic arterial phase.
Potential pitfalls and challenges:
At MRI, aorta may not be brightly enhanced.
With short bolus durations, contrast material bolus may pass beyond aorta by time of image acquisition."

Radiographs and CT scans.—A bronchocele is a tubular or branching Y- or V-shaped structure that may resemble a gloved finger (Fig 13). The CT attenuation of the mucus is generally that of soft tissue but may be modified by its composition (eg, high-attenuation material in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis). In the case of bronchial atresia, the surrounding lung may be of decreased attenuation because of reduced ventilation and, thus, perfusion.  [Fleischner Society]"

Radiographs and CT scans.—On a frontal chest radiograph, the recess is seen as a vertically oriented interface between the right lower lobe and the adjacent mediastinum (the medial limit of the recess). Superiorly, the interface is seen as a smooth arc with convexity to the left. Disappearance or distortion of part of the interface suggests disease (eg, subcarinal lymphadenopathy). On CT scans, the recess (Fig 9) merits attention because small lesions located in the recess will often be invisible on chest radiographs (23). [Fleischner Society]"

cyst,"Any fluid-filled closed cavity or sac that is lined by an epithelium. Cysts can be of normal, abnormal, non-neoplastic, or neoplastic tissues. [MeSH]
Pathology.—A cyst is any round circumscribed space that is surrounded by an epithelial or fibrous wall of variable thickness (51). 
BI-RADS MRI: Circumscribed, round or oval fluid-filled mass with an imperceptible wall, bright on T2-weighted images.
Radiographs and CT scans.—A cyst appears as a round parenchymal lucency or low-attenuating area with a well-defined interface with normal lung. Cysts have variable wall thickness but are usually thin-walled (<2 mm) and occur without associated pulmonary emphysema (Fig 21). Cysts in the lung usually contain air but occasionally contain fluid or solid material. The term is often used to describe enlarged thin-walled airspaces in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (52) or Langerhans cell histiocytosis (53); thicker-walled honeycomb cysts are seen in patients with end-stage fibrosis (54).

Eddy currents also may cause misalignment of the planes of the excitation and refocusing pulses, leading to non-uniform signal intensity across the image."

cryptogenic organizing pneumonia,"A disease formerly considered a form of interstitial pneumonia. Its etiology is obscure but it may be associated with toxic fumes, infection, and connective tissue disease. Clinical symptoms include cough, dyspnea and influenza-like symptoms with the development of the usual interstitial pneumonia in many cases. Obstructive symptoms are limited to smokers. There are patchy polypoid masses of intra-alveolar granulation tissue in small airway lumina and alveolar ducts. """"Organizing"""" refers to unresolved pneumonia (in which the alveolar exudate persists and eventually undergoes fibrosis) in which fibrous tissue forms in the alveoli. (From Segen, Dictionary of Modern Medicine, 1992; Stedman, 25th ed) [MeSH]
Pathology.—Organizing pneumonia manifests as a histologic pattern characterized by loose plugs of connective tissue in the airspaces and distal airways. Interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are minimal or absent. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, or COP, is a distinctive clinical disorder among the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (5), but the histologic pattern of organizing pneumonia is encountered in many different situations, including pulmonary infection, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and collagen vascular diseases. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Airspace consolidation is the cardinal feature of organizing pneumonia on chest radiographs and CT scans. In COP, the distribution is typically subpleural and basal (Fig 45) and sometimes bronchocentric (96). Other manifestations of organizing pneumonia include ground-glass opacity, tree-in-bud pattern, and nodular opacities (37). [Fleischner Society]"

As spinal fluid builds up, it may put abnormal pressure on the spinal cord and damage nerve cells and their connections.  Hydromyelia is sometimes used interchangeably with syringomyelia, the name for a condition that also involves cavitation in the spinal cord.  In hydromyelia, the cavity that forms is connected to the fourth ventricle in the brain, and is almost always associated with infants and children who have hydrocephalus or birth defects such as Chiari Malformation II and Dandy-Walker Malformation.  Syringomyelia, however, features a closed cavity and occurs primarily in adults, the majority of whom have Chiari Malformation II or have experienced spinal cord trauma.   NINDS"

It is important that most breast cancers that form a visible mass are of equal or higher density than an equal volume of fibroglandular tissue.  it is rare (although not impossible) for breast cancer to be lower in density.  breast cancers are never fat-containing (radiolucent) although they may trap fat.

Discitis has been diagnosed in patients following discography, myelography, lumbar puncture, paravertebral injection, and obstetrical epidural anesthesia. Discitis following chemonucleolysis (especially with chymopapain) is attributed to chemical reaction by some and to introduction of microorganisms by others. [MeSH]"

Pathology.—Infarction is a process that may result in ischemic necrosis, usually the consequence of vascular compromise such as occlusion of a feeding pulmonary artery by an embolus (venous infarction is rare but recognized). Necrosis is relatively uncommon because tissue viability is maintained by the bronchial arterial blood supply. Pulmonary infarction may be secondary to a vasculitis (eg, Wegener granulomatosis). 
Radiographs and CT scans.—A pulmonary infarct is typically triangular or dome-shaped, with the base abutting the pleura and the apex directed toward the hilum (Fig 27). The opacity represents local hemorrhage with or without central tissue necrosis (67,68).

Additional clinical features may include muscle rigidity; nystagmus, pathologic; retinal degeneration; muscle spasticity; dementia; urinary incontinence; and ophthalmoplegia. The familial form has an earlier onset (second decade) and may feature spinal cord atrophy. The sporadic form tends to present in the fifth or sixth decade, and is considered a clinical subtype of multiple system atrophy. (From Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, p1085) [MeSH]"

Radiographs and CT scans.—Bronchioles are not identifiable in healthy individuals, because the bronchiolar walls are too thin (4). In inflammatory small-airways disease, however, thickened or plugged bronchioles may be seen as a nodular pattern on a chest radiograph or as a tree-in-bud pattern on CT scans.  [Fleischner Society]"

It may arise from any level of the ventricular system or central canal of the spinal cord. Intracranial ependymomas most frequently originate in the fourth ventricle and histologically are densely cellular tumors which may contain ependymal tubules and perivascular pseudorosettes. Spinal ependymomas are usually benign papillary or myxopapillary tumors.

UIP is the pattern seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but can be encountered in diseases of known cause (eg, some cases of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis). 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Honeycombing with a basal and subpleural distribution (Fig 71) is regarded as pathognomonic (63,65), but not all cases of biopsy-proved UIP have this distinctive CT pattern.  [Fleischner Society]"

The mixed nerve bundles run posterior to the bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate as the “pelvic plexus”. The cavernous nerve arises from the pelvic plexus and runs along the posterolateral aspect of the prostate on each side. Arterial and venous vessels accompany the cavernous nerve, and together these structures form the neurovascular bundles which are best visualized on MR imaging at 5 and 7 o’clock position. At the apex and the base of the prostate, the bundles send penetrating branches through the “capsule”, providing a potential route for extraprostatic tumor spread."

rounded atelectasis,"Pathology.—Rounded atelectasis is rounded collapsed lung associated with invaginated fibrotic pleura and thickened and fibrotic interlobular septa. Most frequently, it is the consequence of an asbestos-induced exudative pleural effusion with resultant pleural scarring (121), but it may occur with any cause of pleural fibrosis. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—On chest radiographs, rounded atelectasis appears as a mass abutting a pleural surface, usually in the posterior part of a lower lobe. Distorted vessels have a curvilinear disposition as they converge on the mass (the comet tail sign). The degree of lobar retraction depends on the volume of atelectatic lung. It is almost invariably associated with other signs of pleural fibrosis (eg, blunting of costophrenic angle). CT is more sensitive for the detection and display of the characteristic features of rounded atelectasis (122,123) (Fig 65). An additional sign is homogeneous uptake of contrast medium in the atelectatic lung. Synonyms include folded lung syndrome, helical atelectasis, Blesovsky syndrome, pleural pseudotumor, and pleuroma.
